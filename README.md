# GuessMyNumber
C# Implementation of a command line guess my number game



Challenges:
1) Stop players from entering text instead of numbers
2) Make the app ask the player if they want to play again after the game ends
3) Make a "reverse guess my number game". ie. user enters a number and the computer makes guesses (as if it can't read that variable).




Hints:
1) Look at what 'Int32.tryparse()' function does
2) Can the program be restarted? Thinking about memory, could there be problems with your solution?  (memory shouldn't be much of a problem for such a basic program)
3) Think about using random numbers and ranges as well as what the best method of guessing would be!
